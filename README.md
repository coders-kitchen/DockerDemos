DockerDemos
===========

Repository that contains all demos that I used during talks and presentations

At the moment the following demos are available

 * [ContainerLinking](ContainerLinking) - Demonstrates how to link containers and make use of volume resources
 * [HelloWorld](HelloWorld) - A simple node.js demo that displays a hello world
 * [UnitTesting](UnitTesting) - This demo demonstrates how to integrate docker into unit tests

Most of the demos are shipped with a demoStart.sh script that allows a convenient way to execute the demo
